## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a time series forecasting project. The goal is to develop and evaluate models capable of predicting future values based on historical time-dependent data. This could be applied to various business problems, such as sales forecasting, demand prediction, stock price prediction (for educational purposes), or resource planning.

This project follows a standard time series analysis and forecasting workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and potential deployment considerations. The code is primarily implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and forecasting-specific libraries like Prophet, ARIMA implementations, or machine learning models adapted for time series. The development and testing are primarily done within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Business Problem (Example - Sales Forecasting)

Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, production planning, budgeting, and overall strategic planning. Underestimating demand can lead to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction, while overestimating can result in excess inventory and increased storage costs. This project aims to develop a model that can predict future sales based on historical sales data, enabling better business decision-making.

## Data Sources

The model is trained and evaluated using historical time series data. The specific data sources and the nature of the data will depend on the forecasting task. Common examples include:

* **Sales Data:** Daily, weekly, or monthly sales figures, potentially broken down by product, region, or customer segment.
* **Demand Data:** Historical records of product demand, often used for inventory planning.
* **Financial Data:** Stock prices, economic indicators, or other financial time series.
* **Web Traffic Data:** Daily or hourly website visits, page views, or user activity.
* **Sensor Data:** Time-stamped readings from sensors in industrial or environmental applications.

The dataset used for this project (if publicly available or simulated) will be described in the data loading section of the Jupyter Notebook. The data typically has at least two columns: a timestamp and the value to be forecasted.
